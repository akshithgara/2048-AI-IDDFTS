You have been provided a sample bash script ("run.sh"); however, you will have to modify this script to suit your needs. 

We have also included a sample .gitignore, because it is bad practice to include executables (such as HelloAI) in your git repo.

Do not forget to add, commit, and push your submission files.

git add FILENAME
git commit -m "meaningfull commit message"
git push

If you have any difficulties, please contact your TAs, who are always happy to help.
